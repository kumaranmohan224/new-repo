Before start execution of our test script, We should establish commuication between Linux and GITHUB server. 
Step 1: Generate a SSH key 
anjali_garg@oa2inbl6146 ~]$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "anjali.garg@mheducation.com"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.

Step2: Set the anme of file where the public key should be save at your server. 
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519): /home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519
/home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519 already exists.
Overwrite (y/n)? Y

Step3: Pass the passphrase to get connected using it and authorize your commuincation by sppliying this. 

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in /home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
----

Step4: Saved the key into the agaent at your server.

[anjali_garg@oa2inbl6146 ~]$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 700719
[anjali_garg@oa2inbl6146 ~]$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
Enter passphrase for /home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519:
Identity added: /home/anjali_garg/.ssh/id_ed25519 (anjali.garg@mheducation.com)

Step5: Get the private key from your key public file
[anjali_garg@oa2inbl6146 ~]$ cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Save it in your git repo account. more details here:
https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh

Step6: Time to test the SSK key pair

git ls-remote -h -- git@github.mheducation.com:MHEducation/INTLWebsiteAutomation.git

If you can't connect check the Firwall inboud rule added in your security policy at your cloud server. 
The common URL schemes for git repositories are:

ssh:// - default port 22
git:// - default port 9418
http:// - default port 80
https:// - default port 443

you can check also if git is responding
